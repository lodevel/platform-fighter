/**
 * Airborne aerial-move input dispatch — AC 60201 Sub-AC 1.
 *
 * Pure helper that mirrors {@link import('./groundedAttackInput').classifyGroundedAttack}
 * for the airborne half of the attack-press dispatcher. Given a single
 * fixed-step's airborne-state flag, attack-input snapshot, the
 * fighter's facing, and a slot table populated by `Character.registerAttack`,
 * it classifies the player's intent into one of three canonical aerial
 * directions (neutral / forward / back) and resolves the active move id
 * through a cascading fallback so partial movesets keep firing.
 *
 * Why a separate module:
 *
 *   • The "airborne state detection + aerial input handling" rule is
 *     a single, tightly-defined contract: aerial attacks fire iff the
 *     fighter is in the air. Lifting the predicate out of `Character.ts`
 *     into a pure helper lets the unit tests assert the contract
 *     without spinning up a Matter scene, and lets AI behaviour trees,
 *     replay drift verifiers, and the (later AC) input-rebinding screen
 *     all read from a single source of truth.
 *   • Determinism: a pure helper is trivially replay-stable. Identical
 *     (snapshot, slots, facing) triples always produce identical
 *     dispatch decisions — exactly the property the replay system
 *     requires.
 *   • Symmetry with the grounded dispatcher: `groundedAttackInput.ts`
 *     pulled out the jab / tilt / smash classifier; this module is the
 *     mirror image for the airborne kit (nair / fair / bair). The two
 *     dispatchers compose into the runtime's full press handler — the
 *     `Character.tickAttack` path picks whichever side matches the
 *     fighter's current grounded flag.
 *
 * Pattern semantics (60 Hz fixed step):
 *
 *   1. **Aerial gate (in-air check).** {@link classifyAerialAttack}
 *      returns `null` immediately when `airborne === false`. This is
 *      the canonical "aerials only fire when off the ground" rule:
 *      a press while grounded routes to the grounded dispatcher
 *      ({@link import('./groundedAttackInput').classifyGroundedAttack}),
 *      not here. The runtime calls this helper only on the air-press
 *      branch but the helper still defends the gate so any caller
 *      (AI synthesiser, replay re-driver) cannot accidentally fire an
 *      aerial from a grounded press.
 *
 *   2. **Heavy press is silently ignored.** A dedicated heavy/smash
 *      button press while airborne is dropped — smashes are grounded
 *      moves; the airborne kit has no smash. This matches the
 *      `Character.tickAttack` legacy path and keeps a player from
 *      accidentally firing a "smash" in mid-air by holding the heavy
 *      button.
 *
 *   3. **Neutral aerial (nair).** Light press with `|moveX|` below the
 *      neutral deadzone {@link AERIAL_STICK_THRESHOLD}. Resolves to
 *      `aerialNeutralId`, then falls through the legacy single-aerial
 *      slot, the light slot, and finally the default slot.
 *
 *   4. **Forward aerial (fair).** Light press with `moveX` past the
 *      deadzone AND the stick sign equals the fighter's facing
 *      *at the moment of the press* (caller passes `prevFacing`).
 *      Resolves to `aerialForwardId`, falling back through
 *      `aerialNeutralId → aerialAttackId → lightAttackId → defaultId`.
 *
 *   5. **Back aerial (bair).** Light press with `moveX` past the
 *      deadzone AND the stick sign opposite the fighter's facing.
 *      Resolves to `aerialBackId`, falling back through
 *      `aerialNeutralId → aerialAttackId → lightAttackId → defaultId`.
 *
 * The cascade order is identical to the existing inline aerial
 * dispatch in `Character.ts` so this extraction is a behaviour-
 * preserving refactor — every existing aerial-dispatch test still
 * passes against the post-extraction wiring.
 *
 * Determinism: pure function of the input snapshot + slot table +
 * facing + threshold. No `Math.random()`, no wall-clock reads. Two
 * replays driving identical input streams against identical slot
 * tables produce identical dispatch decisions every frame.
 *
 * Authoring contract: every call passes a `slots` table read from the
 * live `Character` instance. The slots are independent — clearing
 * `aerialBackId` does NOT clear `aerialNeutralId`. This lets balance
 * tooling disable specific dispatch paths without touching the
 * registered move set.

 *                              "aerial gate" half of Sub-AC 1.
 *   • `attackJustPressed`   — `true` on the rising-edge frame of the
 *                              normal/light attack button. Caller
 *                              detects the rising edge.
 *   • `heavyJustPressed`    — `true` on the rising-edge frame of the
 *                              dedicated heavy/smash button. Always
 *                              dropped while airborne — see semantics
 *                              note 2 in the file header.
 *   • `moveX`               — current-frame stick X in [-1, 1]. Pre-
 *                              clamped by the caller; the helper does
 *                              NOT re-clamp.
 *   • `prevFacing`          — fighter's facing at the moment of the
 *                              press, BEFORE this frame's motion code
 *                              had a chance to flip it. The caller

 *                          (regardless of direction). Used as the

 *      against any caller (AI synthesiser, replay re-driver, future
 *      AC paths) accidentally firing an aerial from a grounded press.
 *
 *   1. **Heavy press is dropped.** If only `heavyJustPressed`, return

 *      airborne are silently ignored, matching the `Character.tickAttack`
 *      legacy behaviour.

 *      smash dispatch).

 *      {@link classifyAerialDirection} from `moveX` + `prevFacing`.
 *
 *   4. **Slot lookup with cascading fallback.** Resolve the move id
 *      through the slot cascade for the matched direction. The

 *   • Only the heavy button rose this frame (heavy is dropped airborne).
 *   • No light press happened.
 *   • Every cascade fallback for the matched direction is empty.
